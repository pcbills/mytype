# MyType

A typing practice game for kids where you can add your own content. Built as a static site for GitHub Pages.

## How to Play

1. **Create a Profile** - Enter your name on the home screen
2. **Pick a Category** - Choose from topics like Pokemon, Animals, Video Games, and Science
3. **Type!** - Press Enter to start, then type the text as accurately and quickly as you can
4. **Track Progress** - See your WPM, accuracy, and total words per entry and across your profile

## Adding New Content

Click the **+ Add New Entry** button on the home screen to add entries through the in-app form. You can also edit `data.js` directly to add entries to the default set.

Each entry needs:
- A **category** (pick existing or create new)
- A **title** (e.g., "Red Panda")
- An **image URL** (displayed alongside the text)
- The **text to type** (the passage the player will practice)
